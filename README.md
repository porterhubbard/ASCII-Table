(+)101

Step 1: Start with the 1's space and add together the 1's column. 

1 + 1 = 10 

Step 2: As per normal addition rules, leave the zero in the ones column and carry the 1 to the 10's column.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1

&nbsp; &nbsp; 101

(+) 101
***
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0

Step 3: Now, add the next place value, which is the 10's place. 

1+0+0 = 1

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1

&nbsp; &nbsp; 101

(+) 101
***
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 0

Step 4: Continue to add the next column, which is the 100's place

1+1=10

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1

&nbsp; &nbsp; 101

(+) 101

***
&nbsp; &nbsp;1 0 1 0

The result is 1010! All numbers that are being added are found in the table of binary numbers, which is a great resource if you find yourself confused about the values used.
