## How to Do Binary Division 

***

Long division is the simplest method of binary division. Binary long division follows the same method of normal long division, with the exception that the output of the long divison results in different values than regular arithmatic.

For the expression: 1110 / 111

The dividend is 1110

The divisor is 111

1110 / 111 = 10

111 fits into 1110 , 10 times
