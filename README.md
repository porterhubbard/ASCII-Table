# Binary Arithmetic

By Porter Hubbard

This tutorial details basic binary arithmetic, and was created for anyone who is interested in beginning their experience with binary basics! 

Binary arithmetic includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each of these pages are options to learn from. The overview of the binary system is listed below. 

Enjoy!

# Binary Overview

The binary system is a way of representing data using 0s and 1s. Because it is only represented in two digits, a computer has an easier time processing the information it is being fed. 

Instead of using a base 10 system, which is what we are typically used to, binary uses a base two. Base 10 consists of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, which can then be combined into other numbers. In base 10, each added digit represents a value that is ten times the previous digit, but in binary each added digit represents a value two times larger than the previous. 

| Binary | Base 10 |
| ------ | --------|
| 1 | 1 | 
|10 | 2 | 
| 11 | 3 | 
| 100 | 4 |
|101|5|
|110|6|
|111|7|
|1000|8|
|1001|9|
|1010|10|



A binary number consists of eight bits, otherwise known as a byte. These are the building blocks of a computer/all computing. To simplify it, they are exclusively capable of turning on and off, which means the computer is able to process this with ease due to its simplicity.
