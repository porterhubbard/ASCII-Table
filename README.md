## How to do Binary Multiplication

***

Let's multiply 1010 and 1011 together

Step 1: Create a space to work with both the multiplicand and the multiplier, one on top of the other.

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0 

x 1 0 1 1

***

Step 2: Multiply the rightmost digit of the multiplier (second number) with each of the digits of the multiplicand (first number)

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0 

x 1 0 1 1

***

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0

1 x 0 = 0 &nbsp; First digit

1 x 1 = 1 &nbsp; Second digit

1 x 0 = 0 &nbsp; Third digit

1 x 1 = 1 &nbsp; Fourth digit

***

Step 3: Next, place one placeholder X under the first column. For each of the following steps, the amount of placeholder X increases by one. After placing the X, continue to multiply with the digit in the tens place of the multiplier with each of the digits of the multiplicand. For each of the following steps, you use the next leftmost digit of the multipiler and multiply with the digits of the multiplicand. (For example, if you were to continue on from this step, you would use the digit in the hundreds place). These digits are placed next to the placeholder X underneath the first set of products from Step 2.

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0 

x 1 0 1 1

***

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0

1 0 1 0 X

1 x 0 = 0 &nbsp; First digit 

1 x 1 = 1 &nbsp; Second digit

1 x 0 = 0 &nbsp; Third digit

1 x 1 = 1 &nbsp; Fourth digit

***

Step 4: Continue step 3 until all digits have been multiplied

&nbsp; &nbsp;  1 0 1 0 

&nbsp; x 1 0 1 1

***

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 0 1 0

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 0 1 0 X

&nbsp; 0 0 0 0 X X 

1 0 1 0 X X X 

***

Step 5: Add each column of products together


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 0 1 0

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 0 1 0 X

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0 0 0 X X 

(+) 1 0 1 0 X X X 

***

1 1 0 1 1 1 0 

The answer of 1010 x 1011 = 1101110
