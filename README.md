## Rules of Binary Subtraction

0 - 0 = 0 

Zero subtracted by zero is zero

1 - 0 = 1

One subtracted by zero is one

1 - 1 = 0

One subtracted by one is zero

0 - 1 = 1

One subtracted by one is one, borrow one rule

## How to do Binary Subtraction

Step 1: For 1010 - 101, start with the ones place.

0 - 1 = 1 (borrow from the tens place)

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0

(-) 1 0 1 

***

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1

Step 2: Subtract the tens place.

0 - 0 = 0

1 Borrow

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0

(-) 1 0 1 

***

&nbsp; &nbsp; 0 1

Step 3: Subtract the hundreds place. 

0 - 1 = 1 (borrow from the thousands place)

1 1 Borrow

&nbsp; 1 0 1 0

(-) 1 0 1 

***

0 1 0 1

The resultant is 0101
